Hi Ciso,

I am writing to you with an urgent security concern that occurred today. Unfortunately, I believe I may have inadvertently clicked on a suspicious link in an email yesterday 4 Jan 2024 at 4.23pm, that I now suspect to be a phishing attempt. The email was sent by do-not-reply@microsoft-help.com, with the title “Unusual activity detected”. After clicking on the email, it directed me to a page that required me to key in my particulars (name, organization name, job title, DOB and phone number) which I did. So far, I have not noticed any unusual activity on my system. 

Thank you.
